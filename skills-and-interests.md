I completed the Skills and Interests module as part of the Project Presentation 3 coursework. This interactive module helped me understand how my values, strengths, and interests influence my future career direction.

## ðŸ’­ Reflection (STAR)

**S â€“ Situation:**  
As part of my career development module, I was introduced to an online activity designed to help students identify their core values and skillsets.

**T â€“ Task:**  
My task was to complete the Skills and Interests module and reflect on how my personal preferences could align with my future profession.

**A â€“ Action:**  
I paid close attention to the learning content, explored examples, and answered quiz-based scenarios to test my understanding. I took notes on which skills I naturally gravitate toward and how those could apply to careers in ICT.

**R â€“ Result (What I learned):**  
I learned how to differentiate between values, interests, and skills â€” and realized Iâ€™m especially drawn to teamwork, logical problem-solving, and creativity. I now have a clearer idea of what roles might suit me in the tech industry (e.g., software development, UX design, or data analysis).
