I completed the "Create a CV" formative module on **3 March 2025**, which focused on the structure, purpose, and essential components of a professional curriculum vitae.


## ðŸ’­ Reflection (STAR)

**S â€“ Situation:**  
As part of my career preparation, I was required to complete an interactive training module on creating a CV, aimed at helping me understand what employers look for in a professional rÃ©sumÃ©.

**T â€“ Task:**  
My task was to demonstrate knowledge of the CVâ€™s key sections â€” such as education, work experience, and skills â€” and apply that by preparing or reviewing my own.

**A â€“ Action:**  
I completed a multiple-choice quiz that tested my understanding of how to structure content, what information to include, and how to present it professionally. I also reviewed my own CV and updated it based on what I learned.

**R â€“ Result (What I learned):**  
I learned that a strong CV must be clear, well-structured, and tailored to the job you're applying for. I gained confidence in my ability to describe my academic background, technical skills, and relevant experiences in a way that aligns with industry expectations. I also learned how to prioritize content and use formatting to enhance readability.
