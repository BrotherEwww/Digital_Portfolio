# Personality Assessment


I completed the Personality Assessment module on **21 February 2025** as part of the PRP370-1-2S work readiness training. The module explored how different personality types align with various career paths and helped me understand where my own preferences might fit within the workplace.


Topics included:
- Career matching with personality types
- The "Realistic", "Artistic", and "Conventional" personality traits
- Preferences for working with data, systems, and people

## ðŸ’­ Reflection (STAR)

**S â€“ Situation:**  
As part of the work readiness portfolio, I was tasked with completing a self-assessment that matched personality traits with potential career paths.

**T â€“ Task:**  
The goal was to understand how personality influences professional preferences and success, and to discover how this applies to my own ICT career path.

**A â€“ Action:**  
I completed a series of questions that required me to analyze personality traits (e.g., artistic, realistic, conventional) and how they align with various career types. I took note of which traits I resonate with most.

**R â€“ Result (What I learned):**  
I learned that my personality type blends analytical and creative traits â€” a combination that's well suited for careers in software development, UI/UX design, or data science. I also realized how important it is to choose work environments that align with my natural preferences to stay motivated and productive.
