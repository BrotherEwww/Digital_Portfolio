# CV Submission



As part of the PRP370-1-2S assessment, I submitted my updated CV for review. The submission process required me to ensure that my CV was complete, professional, and aligned with the expectations of potential employers.


## ðŸ’­ Reflection (STAR)

**S â€“ Situation:**  
After creating and refining my CV, I was required to submit it through Blackboard as part of the work readiness training.

**T â€“ Task:**  
My task was to finalize my CV, ensure it reflected my most up-to-date academic and professional background, and submit it in the correct format.

**A â€“ Action:**  
I reviewed my CV for formatting, spelling, and accuracy. I double-checked that it included all the key sections: personal info, education, work experience, technical and soft skills. I then exported it as a PDF and uploaded it to Blackboard before the deadline.

**R â€“ Result (What I learned):**  
I learned how important it is to treat a CV like a personal brand document â€” it must be professional, precise, and tailored to the role or opportunity. Submitting my CV made me more confident about applying for internships or entry-level positions, knowing I have a polished and compelling rÃ©sumÃ© ready.
